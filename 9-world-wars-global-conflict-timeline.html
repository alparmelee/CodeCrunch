            <p class="subtitle">The Age of Total War and International Reorganization (1914-1950)</p>
        </header>
        
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>This chapter examines the era of global conflict that transformed international relations, redrew maps, and caused unprecedented human suffering in the first half of the 20th century. We trace the origins and consequences of World War I, which ended empires and introduced new forms of mechanized warfare. The interwar period saw economic crisis, the rise of totalitarian regimes, and failed attempts at collective security. World War II followed with even greater destruction, genocide, and ultimately the use of atomic weapons. From these catastrophes emerged new international institutions and a bipolar world divided by the Cold War, reshaping global politics for decades to come.</p>

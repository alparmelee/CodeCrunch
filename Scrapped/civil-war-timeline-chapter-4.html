                    significance: "Lincoln's election, despite his promise not to interfere with slavery where it existed, was viewed by many Southerners as an existential threat to their way of life, setting in motion the events that would lead to civil war.",

                    significance: "This first act of secession marked the beginning of the Confederacy and destroyed decades of compromise efforts. South Carolina's action provided a template that other Southern states would quickly follow.",

                    significance: "The formation of the Confederacy represented a fundamental challenge to the Union and the Constitution. Their constitution explicitly protected slavery while maintaining most other elements of the U.S. Constitution.",

                    significance: "This carefully worded speech defined Lincoln's initial position on both secession and slavery. While conciliatory toward the South on slavery, Lincoln firmly rejected the constitutional right to secede.",

                    significance: "This attack marked the beginning of the Civil War, transforming a constitutional crisis into armed conflict. In response, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers, prompting four more states to secede and join the Confederacy.",

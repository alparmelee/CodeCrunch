                definition: "Multiprogramming is a method used by operating systems to run multiple programs simultaneously by managing their execution. This technique increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs (code and data) so that the CPU always has one to execute.",

            {
                term: "Deadlock",
                definition: "Deadlock is a situation in operating systems where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. Deadlocks can cause the involved processes to remain in a perpetual waiting state, effectively halting their progress.",

            {
                term: "Starvation",
                definition: "Starvation is a condition where a process is perpetually denied the necessary resources to proceed, often because other processes are continually receiving the resources it needs. This can occur in systems where resources are allocated with unfair priorities.",

                term: "Binary Semaphores",
                definition: "Binary semaphores, also known as mutexes, are synchronization tools used to control access to a resource. A binary semaphore can have only two values: 0 and 1. It is used to ensure that only one process or thread can access a critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.",

            {
                term: "Race Condition",
                definition: "A race condition occurs when the behavior of software depends on the relative timing of events such as the order of execution of processes or threads. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable and erroneous behavior if not managed properly, typically through synchronization mechanisms.",

                term: "Monitor",
                definition: "A monitor is a high-level synchronization construct that provides a convenient way to achieve mutual exclusion and condition synchronization. It encapsulates shared variables, the operations that can be performed on them, and the synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one process can execute a monitor procedure at a time.",

                definition: "A critical section is a portion of code that accesses shared resources (such as variables, data structures, or hardware devices) that must not be concurrently accessed by more than one thread or process. Proper synchronization mechanisms are used to protect critical sections.",

                term: "Spinlock",
                definition: "A spinlock is a type of lock that causes a thread attempting to acquire it to simply wait in a loop (\"spin\") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available. Because the thread remains active and consumes CPU time, spinlocks are typically used in scenarios where the lock is expected to be held for a very short time.",

                term: "Decrement",
                definition: "In the context of synchronization, decrement refers to the operation of decreasing the value of a semaphore. For example, in the P operation (proberen, Dutch for \"to test\") of a semaphore, the value is decremented, and if the resulting value is negative, the process is blocked until the value becomes non-negative.",

                term: "Condition Variables",
                definition: "Condition variables are synchronization primitives that enable threads to wait until a particular condition occurs. They are used in conjunction with a mutex to manage the condition checking and signaling, allowing threads to block until another thread signals that the condition has been met.",

            {
                term: "Indirect Messages",
                definition: "Indirect message passing involves communication between processes through an intermediary, such as a message queue or a mailbox. Processes send and receive messages without knowing each other's identity, promoting decoupling and flexibility in process interactions.",

                term: "The Reader/Writer Problem",
                definition: "The reader/writer problem is a classic synchronization problem that deals with scenarios where multiple threads need to read and write shared data. The challenge is to design a system where multiple readers can read simultaneously, but writers must have exclusive access to the resource to prevent data inconsistency.",

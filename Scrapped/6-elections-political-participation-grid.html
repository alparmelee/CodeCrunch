                <p>The right to vote in political elections. Throughout U.S. history, the expansion of suffrage has broadened from property-owning white men to include all citizens over 18, regardless of race, sex, or economic status.</p>

                <p>Prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Despite this amendment, many states used poll taxes, literacy tests, and other measures to prevent Black Americans from voting until the 1960s.</p>

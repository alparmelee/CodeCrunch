                    The Navajo Code was a code developed by Philip Johnston, a non-Navajo who grew up on a Navajo reservation and was fluent in the language. He proposed it to the Marine Corps as a way to send secure messages. The code was based on the Navajo language, which was considered ideal because it was unwritten, unintelligible to non-Navajos, and had a complex grammar and syntax.

                    The code worked by using a two-part system:
                    <br>
                    1. A phonetic alphabet: For spelling out words that didn't have a Navajo equivalent, the code used Navajo words that corresponded to a letter in the English alphabet. For example, the Navajo word for 'ant' (wol-la-chee) was used to represent the letter 'A'.
                    <br>
                    2. A dictionary of military terms: The code also had a dictionary of common military terms that were assigned specific Navajo code words. For example, a battleship was called 'lo-tso' (whale), and a hand grenade was 'ni-mas-ba-eh' (round potato).
                    <br>
                    This system allowed for fast and secure communication, as the code was both complex and flexible.

                    1. Its complexity: The Navajo language is an unwritten language with a very complex syntax and grammar, making it virtually impossible for non-speakers to learn or decipher.
                    <br>
                    2. The small number of non-Navajo speakers: At the time, there were very few people outside of the Navajo tribe who could speak the language, and even fewer who could understand its nuances, making it a highly secure choice for a code.

            <p>This chapter explores the dramatic transformations of the modern world since the mid-20th century. Beginning with the Cold War's ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, we trace the decolonization movements that reshaped Africa and Asia, and the civil rights movements that transformed societies internally. The chapter examines globalization's economic and cultural impacts, unprecedented technological innovation, rising environmental challenges, and the complex geopolitical landscape of the 21st century, including the rise of China, terrorism, and increasing global interdependence.</p>

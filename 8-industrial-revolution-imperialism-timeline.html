        <div class="introduction">
            <p>This chapter examines the interconnected phenomena of industrialization and imperialism that transformed the world in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Beginning with technological innovations in Britain that sparked the Industrial Revolution, we trace how factory production, mechanization, and steam power revolutionized manufacturing and transportation. These changes profoundly altered society, creating new urban working classes, changing labor patterns, and prompting reform movements. Simultaneously, European powers embarked on a new phase of imperial expansion, colonizing large portions of Africa and Asia in pursuit of raw materials, markets, and geopolitical advantage. We explore both the economic drivers of imperialism and indigenous resistance to colonial rule.</p>
